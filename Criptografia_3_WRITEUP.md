# Cryptography Challenge 2

## Description

Cryptography and Reverse.

## Requirements 

- python3

## Sources

- encode.py
- flag.txt


```
The Flag has been encoded using the encode.py script. Can you reverse the script and discover the Flag?
```


## Exploit

You need a basic understanding of python, and what the script does. 

Then you simply need to do the reverse steps of the code to obtain the Flag.


## Solution 

One of the solutions can be seen on the [decode.py](./decode.py) script.

Another one is to decode the Flag, and using an ASCII table, decrement 3 from each value and see its characters to obtain the Flag.
